5. Glossary

5.1 Basic terms accepted in this edition of the rules:

“Single” – a bet on a single event;

“Express” – this is a bet on the outcome of several different events simultaneously. When you place a bet on the outcome of two or more events (for example, two different football matches), you can unite them in “Express”. To win an express bet it is necessary for you do not have any failed predictions (losses) on any of the outcomes which are included in the Express. Loss on one of the outcomes of an express bet means loss throughout the entire bet. Winnings of the express bets are equal to the product of the bet amount at the coefficients of played outcomes included in the express (if one of the bets included in the express occurs a return, then the coefficient on it equals 1).

“Handicap” – the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of competition, expressed in goals (points/) sets, etc., which is provided by the bookmaker office to the entrant with bets on it. The result of the event subject to the handicap is determined in this way: the handicap given to the entrant is added to the corresponding result shown by the entrant in the competition. If the results thus obtained are in favor of the elected entrant, he is considered as a winner and the bets on his win subject to the handicap win. Payments are carried out with the coefficient of winnings indicated in the description of bets. If the result is in favor of the opponent – the bets are lost. If the result subject to the handicap is a draw, then the coefficient of winnings under such a result will be equal to 1 (return of the bet);

For example:

Team 1 Team 2 Handicap 1 Handicap 2 Coefficient 1 Coefficient 2

Inter Cagliari -1.5 2.25 +1.5 1.9

1) Suppose you want to bet upon the win of Cagliari subject to handicap. The handicap betting on Cagliari (Handicap 2) is equal to “+1.5′′. To win with the bet on the handicap “+1.5′′ Cagliari mustn't lose by more than 1 goal, as handicap +1.5 will be added to goals from Cagliari. Let us analyze all the options:

Cagliari won or the teams drew or Cagliari lost by the difference of 1 goal. For example, the final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result 2:2.5 in favor of Cagliari (the handicap of Inter when determining the result on the rates at Cagliari is not taken into account). The bets win.

Cagliari lost by more than 1 goal difference. For example, the final score is 2-0. Taking into account the handicap (+1.5) the result is 2:1.5 in favor of Inter. In this case, the rates on winning of Cagliari taking into account the handicap (+1.5) lose.

2) Similarly, the following variants are possible when betting on a win for Inter taking into account the handicap “-1.5′′:

Inter won having the advantage of two or more goals. For example, the final score is 3-0. Taking into account the handicap (- 1.5) the result is 1.5:0 in favor of Inter. The bets win.

Inter won having the advantage of 1 goal, teams drew or Cagliari won. For example, the final score is 2-1. Taking into account the handicap -1.5, the result of the bets on Inter at handicap (-1.5) gives 0.5:1, in favor of Cagliari. In this case, the bets on Inter with the handicap -1.5 lose.

A double bet of handicap is offered (Asian handicap). Bet on victory or total taking into account the handicap, which is the multiple of 0.25 (but not of 0.5). Such bets are calculated as 2 bets with the half of sum: with the same odd and “common handicaps” and “common totals” multiple of 0.5’s nearby common value. In case when the Asian handicap is included in parlay or system, it is calculated with that odd which would be in the case of a single bet. In the case of winning two common bets, the bet’s odd “O” is taken into account in the calculations. If one common bet is won and the other is subject to refund, during the calculation is taken the odd (“O”+1)/2. If both common bets are lost, the whole bet is considered lost.

Event’s participant Handicap’s double bet (Asian handicap) Odd

Real -0.25 (0,-0.5) 2.0

Barcelona +0.25 (0,+0.5) 1.8

In case 200 euro stake is made on “Real” and “Real” won: two common bets with the half of sum won and the winning is equal to 100*2.0 + 100*2.0 = 400 euros. The match was over indrawn: one common bet with the half of the sum lost, and the other won with the odd “1′′ and the winning is equal to 100*0.0 + 100*1.0 = 100 euros. “Real” lost: two common bets with the half of sum lost and the winning is equal to 100*0.0 + 100*0.0 = 0 euro. In case 200 euros stake is made on “Barcelona” and ”Barcelona” won: two common bets with the half of sum won and the winning is equal to 100*1.8 + 100*1.8 = 360 euros. The match was over in draw: one common bet with the half of sum lost, and the other won with the odd “1′′ and the winning is equal to 100*1.8 + 100*1.0 = 280 euros. “Barcelona” lost: two common bets with the half of sum lost and the winning is equal to 100*0.0 + 100*0.0 = 0 euro.

“Total” – the number of goals, pucks, points, or the games, scored (thrown, gained, or played) by an entrant or entrants of events.

For example:

Suppose the total of the soccer game is set (the number of goals scored) equal to “4′′, and wagering is offered on the total at two outcomes: more or less of the given total.

If the match is scored with a total of fewer than 4 goals (0-0, 1-0, 0-1, 1-1, etc.), bets lower than “4′′ win.

If the match is scored with a total of more than 4 goals (4-1, 4-2, 3-2, etc.), bets lower than “4′′ lose and bets more than “4′′ win.

If the match is scored with a total of exactly 4 goals (3-1, 4-0, 2-2, 1-3, 0-4), all bets on more than “4′′ and less than “4′′ will be refunded.

6. Policy of Bets

6.1 The values of the parameters (including handicaps, totals) and coefficients of the events specified in the line of the current day may change after any bet, but conditions before bets are the same, except in cases of technical and obvious mistakes in the line.

6.2 As an amount of bet only the amount confirmed and registered by the company is accepted.

6.3 The User is the only person who is responsible for the bet. Once a bet is made and its acceptance is confirmed, it cannot be changed or canceled by the User. EasyWin does not provide any guarantees for the “lost” or “double” bets made by customers. Please carefully check all the bets you have made.

6.4 Loss of your password cannot be a reason for the withdrawal rates or cancellation of the request for payment of winnings.

6.5 A bet is accepted as soon as it is confirmed by the company. All accepted bets are displayed in the “Bet Record”. In some cases, there may be a delay until a bet is listed in your record. In case of any dispute, the time when the bet was registered in the system of the company is considered to be its true submission time. If the user did not receive any notification about the acceptance of the bet, the rate is still considered to be accepted if it is displayed in the “Bet record.”

6.6 Failures of communication or other technical failures in customer communications are not a reason for the cancellation of a bet if the bet has been registered in the server.

7. Displaying Data

7.1 The Company is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the proposed information services, including data on the events of Live and mailing services.

7.2 EasyWin makes every effort to make the information on Live events (such as results, the time of a game, and the statistics of teams /players) correct. However, this information is displayed only for informational purposes. EasyWin is not responsible in case of any errors in this data.

7.3 EasyWin is not responsible and does not accept any claims regarding the accuracy of the translation from foreign languages of team names and the names of the players.

7.4 If in the indicated event/match more than one member with the same surname is present and during bet acceptance, the full name of the athlete or other features identifying them uniquely have not been indicated, all bets are refundable.

7.5 If in the name of the match or in the name of the position one or more entrants are indicated in the line incorrectly (except for translation errors), that is if the other team/entrant of the represented tournament is indicated instead of the necessary one, all the bets on that event are recognized as invalid and a return is made. Only EasyWin has the right to determine the events belonging to this category.

7.6 In cases when the specific details of the team such as a particular age group (for example 18 years/to 21 years/youth teams), gender (women), or the status of the team (reserve) are not indicated in the line resulting in the marking of the other team in the line instead of the declared one, all bets on this match are refundable. In other cases when an incomplete name or possible grammar errors are indicated in the line, all bets remain in force. If the gender of teams is not indicated in the line, it is considered that the gender of teams is male. In case women’s teams are participating in a match it is necessary to have a detailed indication about it in the line otherwise bets on this match are subject to return.

7.7 Date and time indicated in the line are the date and time of discontinuation of betsˈ acceptance on the event (except for Live events) and do not necessarily coincide with the date and time of the actual start of the event. The actual time of the event while counting the bets is considered as the time of the start of the event, which is determined based on the official documents of the organization conducting the competition, as well as the data of EasyWin.

7.8 If the place of conducting a meeting is not indicated in the line, in the list of events the host of the field is indicated firstly, except for competitions of American types of sports. All the information contained in the “cap” to a particular sport, carries an ancillary character. Possible errors in the given information are not a ground for the return of bets.

7.9 On acceptance of bets for Live Events there is a set delay, the value of which may vary depending on the sport, market, and other features, and it is determined exclusively by EasyWin for security and protection from subsequent bets.

7.10 For clients convenience, taking into account the specificity of Live Events in which coefficients change very often a client can choose one of the following options: to “Accept all changes in the coefficients”, “Accept only marked-up bets” or “Do not accept bets if the coefficients change,” which determines respectively whether the bet is accepted if during the time of its arrangement the coefficient changed, at any changes of it, or just in the case when the changed bet exceeds the estimated coefficient of the bet of the client.

7.11 Incorrectly indicated date of the conducted match is not a ground for cancellation of the bet.

7.12 If the match began from the moment at which it was previously interrupted, and in the line that was not stipulated, the bets are refundable.

8. Interlocking events and outcomes

8.1 In “express” bets it is forbidden to include different events that relate to the same match, not even the ones which are interdependent directly. If in such bets were included any events that relate to the given match, this bet is refundable, even if the computer program accepting the bettings did not block this bet during its submission. EasyWin reserves the exclusive right to determine whether the events are connected.

8.2 In the game on output-absence from the group in “express” bets it is allowed only to bet on one team from the given group. If in such bets qualify-not qualify of the teams from the same group were included then the given bets are refundable, even if the computer program accepting the bets did not block this bet during its submission. EasyWin reserves the unique right to decide whether to accept bets on the position of qualify or not qualify in “express” and in “single” bets.

9. Obvious and technical errors

9.1 The Company is not responsible for errors in typing, transfer, or counting of bets. In particular, EasyWin reserves the right to correct obvious errors made while entering information on betting coefficients and/or calculation of the amounts at the bets (for example, errors in the coefficients indicated in teams incorrectly, incorrectly indicated events, etc.), or declare invalid the corresponding bets even after completion of the event. In the cases of correcting obvious errors bets are returned. The most common types of technical errors are the following:

9.1.1 Errors of input of coefficients – when the coefficient (or the setting of the handicap/total, etc.) is displayed without a separator (dot) or with any additional number.

For example: instead of the coefficient 1.8, 18 is displayed, instead of 2, 23 is displayed, instead of 3, 30 is displayed, etc.

9.1.2 “Mirror Errors” – when the coefficients for players are displayed in a diametrically opposite manner. In this case, the favorite of the game (including a current favorite of the live event) is displayed by a coefficient exceeding the coefficient of the outsider of the given event.

Example: Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. Instead of 1.2 and 4, 4and 1.2 is displayed.

9.1.3 Writing errors – if all the coefficients are indicated correctly, however, teams are written in an incorrect order (usually occurs for events taking place on a neutral field).

Meaning for the previous example: record: Basketball. Unicaja-Barcelona. The winner of the match. 1.2 and 4 instead of Basketball. Barcelona-Unicaja. The winner of the match. 1,2 and 4

Clear indicators of obvious errors are very large differences in the coefficients of EasyWin and other bookmakers, the coefficients that are nearly impossible to give in the current situation of the match.

The right to determine whether or not an obvious or a technical error was made in any case belongs exclusively to EasyWin.

9.2 EasyWin reserves the right to abolish the bets made on deliberately incorrect coefficients and obvious errors. The customer will be informed about changes in the balance immediately.

9.3 EasyWin reserves the right to cancel the bets even after the end of the event if these bets are won by the User as a result of a technical failure or an obvious error.

9.4 In cases when due to technical reasons the User’s bets were not provided with the necessary amount of funds in the account, the bets are considered invalid.

9.5 In case of mistakenly having credited the means to the customer’s account the latter shall immediately notify EasyWin about the mistake. If due to an error a negative balance has been formed at the client, the betting company has the right to cancel the uncalculated bets even though they were made before the error occurred.

9.6 The Company reserves the right to oblige the User to liability for any damage caused to it if the user used a technical or administrative error intentionally when making a deposit and/or during the receipt of money on the account.

11.8 In case of any claims and disputes from the Users’ side and people representing their parties, the company’s liabilities are limited by the size of bets or its possible winnings.

11.9 In case of any disputes or claims the database of EasyWin has priority over any other data.

11.10 If there is a discrepancy between the English version of these rules and the translation into another language, the English version is considered to be the correct one.

11.11 Any matters of dispute including claims about the results of the event are accepted to be reviewed by the bookmaker office within 5 days from the end of the sporting event.

11.12 EasyWin does not hold Users’ funds in segregated or separately protected bank accounts. The User needs to understand that deposits of EasyWin are not in banks and no interest is accrued upon them.

12. Restrictions on rates

12.1 Bookmaker company has the right not to accept bets from any person without giving any reason and reserves the right to close or temporarily block the accounts of individual Users without prior notice.

12.2 Minimum and maximum size of bets for all sporting events are defined by the bookmaker office and are subject to changes without prior written notice. Also, EasyWin reserves the right to impose special restrictions on the accounts of individual Users.

12.3 EasyWin does not recommend two or more Users to place bets from one IP-address (from the same computer or the same local area network) to avoid suspicion of collusion (cheating). In such cases, it is necessary to reconcile the possibility of the game with EasyWin by explaining the circumstances. EasyWin has the right to block the account of such a User and ask them to send the documents verifying their registered identity.

12.4 Winnings are paid only within the limits set with maximum limits of the company. If the User has made a bet and the winning exceeds the maximum, the company will not pay any amount of money exceeding the maximum limit.

13. Late bets

13.1 Bets placed after the start of the event, except the bets for Live Events, in all cases, are invalid and are returnable, and are excluded from the “express” bets. Any bet (including bets for Live Events) made on an event, the result of which is already known by the time of betting is considered invalid and will be refunded.

13.2 If the User wishes to challenge the time of the start of the event, he must provide an official document (or a link to the website of regulatory bodies of the given event) which confirms the actual time of the start of the match on which the given bet was made.

13.3 While arising disputes regarding the time of the start of the event, if the official regulatory bodies of the appropriate tournament/event do not provide (or lack) such information, the information of EasyWin about the start time of the event is considered the only correct one while calculating the bets.

14. Return

14.1 If a “return” is declared about the bet, such a bet is considered as won with the coefficient of 1. In the case of “Single” bets, this means that the User will get back the amount of money placed on this bet. In the case of “express” bets, the total coefficient will be changed accordingly (in the event, where a return occurred, the coefficient will get the value 1, the coefficients on the remaining events will remain unchanged, and the final coefficient will be counted according to similar scheme; only the coefficient of the outcome on the event, on which was given a return – one of the factors (multipliers) of the final coefficient of “express” – will get the value 1).

EXAMPLE: Express

Position Outcome Coefficient

Finland - Moldova Win 1 1.55

Malta-Croatia Croatia Handicap (-2) 1.7

Bulgaria-England Win 2 1.5

Total coefficient of Express = 1.55 * 1.7 * 1.5 = 3.95

In case Finland and England won in the above-mentioned games, and Croatia won by 2 goals advantage, and the given express plays, but when calculating the total coefficient there will be 1 instead of 1.7 (coefficient of winning) and the final coefficient of the given expression will be equal to 1.55*1*1.5 = 2.325

14.2 If as a result of the match the total number of scored goals is equal to the total of the bet and among the proposed outcomes of the given total bets there has not been the option equal ... (the indicated number) of goals, a return is made. Similarly, for the individual totals, totals of the player totals of cards/corners /removals, fouls, and other parameters if the final value of the match and the proposed parameter of the total are equal a return is made.

15. Privacy of User’s data

15.1 The User is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any information related to their account and shall take all measures to prevent the use of personal accounts by unauthorized persons. Any operations confirmed by the Mobile phone number and password of the account holder shall be valid and have legal force.

17. Neutral field

17.1 In cases when the match is transferred to a neutral field (NF) rates persist. They are refundable in cases when the match is transferred to the opponent’s field. In the case of the play when the teams are from the same city and are transferred to another field, bets are valid and are not refundable. In international matches, the refund of bets is made only when the match transfers to the field of an opponent state.
